= What is WikiModel?

- WikiModel is a Data Model defining the structure of wiki documents
  - Defines wiki document elements and rules of their possible imbrications (like DTD/Schema for XML documents)
- WikiModel is an API providing access to the structure of wiki documents
  - This API gives access to and control over the internal structure of individual wiki documents
  - Usage of this API guaranties that the accessed wiki documents respect the structure defined by the model
 
= What WikiModel isn't?

- It is not a Wiki Engine
- It does not work with a data storage, versioning, access rights,...
- It does not check or validate references between documents


= How can WikiModel be used?

- As a rendering engine to transform various wiki  syntaxes to formatted content (HTML, PDF, TeX, ...)
- As a parser for semantic annotations

= WikiModel v1 and v2: Comparision

== WikiModel v1

- Exists only one WikiModel-specific  syntax 
- Real grammar based parser (JavaCC)
- Possibility to work with “embedded” documents
- Semantic statements about documents 

== WikiModel v2 

- Keeps all the features of v1 +
- All parsers much faster than v1
- CommonSyntax manipulates with greater number of structural elements than in v1
- Possibilities to work with documents written with multiple syntaxes
- All parsers are based on real JavaCC grammars
- Possibility to work with “embedded” documents
- Semantic statements about parts of the text  

= How WikiParser (v2) works

= Features of WikiModel v2

- WikiModel itself does not depend on any particular wiki syntax
  - WikiModel manipulates with a fixed number of structural element types and defines their possible assembly/imbrication
  - Simplified structure (relative to XHTML)  greatly simplifies the validation and manipulation of documents
  - The document schema is sufficiently flexible to simulate almost any HTML formatting (like tables with embedded lists, headers and paragraphs)
  - This is a super-set of structural elements existing in others wikies, so the information from any wiki can be imported without loosing the information or structure
- Contains notions of semantic statements about the  documents and parts of a document
- CommonSyntax manipulates with all possible structural elements defined by the WikiModel v2
- Parsers for multiple wiki syntaxes are available (JspWiki, XWiki, MediaWiki, Creole, GoogleCode wiki, ...). 
  - All parsers give access to the valid structure of documents. If a document contains non-valid elements (non-closed markup or overlapping elements) then it will be fixed automatically
